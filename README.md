GitDummy
========

Ever wanted to include your private repository contributions to your contribution panel? Well now you can. This script will read from an existing repository and transcribe all of the commit messages into a dummy repository that you can then add publicly to your GitHub account. This script transfers no source code, only commit stubs and their associated dates.

Usage is simple:
```
python gitdummy.py
```
